im2pix is a tool to convert image to pseudo pixel art. It's a reduced version 

## Installation

You can install the released version of im2pix from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("im2pix")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(im2pix)
library(imager)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
plot(sample_im)
```

```{r}
out_pic <- imtopix(sample_im, pal = "contra", blockSize = 8)
plot(out_pic)
```



```{r}
out_pic <- imtopix(sample_im, pal = "gameboy", blockSize = 8)
plot(out_pic)
```
